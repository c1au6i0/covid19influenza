# COVID-19 and influenza vaccination coverage

This repository contains the scripts used to analyzed the data reported in the paper:

*Influenza Vaccination and COVID-19 Mortality in USA* \n

Claudio Zanettini\*, Mohamed Omar\*, Wikum Dinalankara, Eddie Luidy Imada, Elizabeth Colantuoni, Giovanni Parmigiani, and Luigi Marchionni.

## Files and folders:

### code/scripts

Contains the scripts for retrieving, pre-processing and analyzing the data.


* `code/script/libraries_functions`: loads the libraries (including `covid19census`).

* `code/script/functions_analysis`: contains functions used to pre-process, analyze and summarize data. Functions are documented.

* `code/scripts/us_preprocess`: this is used to retrieve and pre-process U.S data. Execution of this script returns the dataframe used for the analyses (`dat_selected`). A static copy of the dataframe is in  `data/data_selected_variables.RDS`.

* `code/strata_selected_variables.R`: used to perform stratified and stability analyses.

* `code/strata_selected_variables.R`: includes the analyses in which propesity score is divided in quintiles or tertiles and added to the linear model as a factor or left as a continous variable.

### code/analyses.R

The file `analyses.R` executes all the scripts in `code/scripts` and aggregate results in 2 dataframes and in a table.

---------------------------------------

## Sources and data

The file `data/data_selected_variables.RDS` contains a static copy of the data used for the analysis.

Details regarding the data sources as well as functions to extract updated COVID-19 data and aggregate them with other socio-economic and health related metrics can be found in the [covid19census R package](https://github.com/c1au6i0/covid19census). Please refer to the package README or documentation for more information regarding the variables. The scripts used to import static data are reported in the package repository [here](https://github.com/c1au6i0/covid19census/data-raw/).
